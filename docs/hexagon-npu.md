# Hexagon NPU FastRPC Backend for GGML

## Overview

The Hexagon NPU FastRPC backend provides hardware acceleration for GGML operations using Qualcomm's Hexagon NPU capabilities. This backend is **built entirely from scratch using Qualcomm's FastRPC framework**, providing a low-level alternative to QNN SDK-based implementations. By bypassing high-level abstractions and programming directly with HVX intrinsics, it is designed to offload compute-intensive operations from the CPU to Qualcomm's specialized Hexagon NPU hardware, enabling maximum performance and power efficiency for machine learning workloads on Snapdragon platforms.

## Key Features

### Direct Hardware Programming
- **Raw HVX Intrinsics**: Critical operations like `mul_mat` and `add` implemented using direct Hexagon Vector Extensions
- **Custom Thread Pool**: 4-thread parallel execution matching NPU hardware capabilities with intelligent load balancing

### Testing Methodology
We extended the `test-backend-ops` to include large matrix multiplication scenarios that represent typical LLM inference patterns:

### Key Observations

The benchmark results reveal several important insights about the Hexagon NPU FastRPC implementation:

- **Dequantization Bottleneck**:
  - For quantized formats, 90-96% of NPU time is spent on dequantization, making this our primary optimization target

- **Compute Efficiency**:
  - When data resides in VTCM memory, the NPU shows excellent computational performance (~10,000 μs) for matrix multiplication operations
  - This represents a ~4× improvement over CPU FP32 performance when comparing pure computation time
  - However, the overall NPU performance is currently limited by memory transfers and dequantization overhead

- **Memory Access Patterns**:
  - Pure F32 computation on NPU (~90,000 μs) is slower than CPU (~39,000 μs) due to memory access patterns
  - The significant performance difference between F32 and post-dequantization Q4_0/Q8_0 execution suggests optimization potential through better VTCM utilization

- **Communication Overhead**:
  - The host_param_update time (700-800 μs) represents FastRPC communication overhead
  - While minimal for large operations, this overhead becomes proportionally significant for smaller tensor operations
  - Batching operations into larger computation graphs would help amortize these costs

## Future Developments

- **Extended Operation Coverage**: Additional custom HVX implementations for more GGML operations (attention, softmax, etc.)
- **Dynamic Thread Scheduling**: Runtime load balancing and work-stealing across the 4 hardware threads
- **Performance Profiling Suite**: Custom profiling tools for FastRPC execution paths and bottleneck analysis
- **Advanced Graph Fusion**: Sophisticated operation fusion techniques to minimize memory transfers and maximize NPU utilization
